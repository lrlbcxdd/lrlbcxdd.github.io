# 🔥 About Me

I am Ronglin Lu, a Master's student in the Class of 2025 at the [School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://saids.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I am currently working under the guidance of [Professor Zhicheng Zhong](https://saids.ustc.edu.cn/2024/0530/c36361a642532/page.htm), with research interests in AI for Materials and AI Agents.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree from 2021 to 2025 at the [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University, where I worked under the supervision of [Professor Leyi Wei](https://wei-group.net/). My research during my undergraduate studies focused on bioinformatics.
